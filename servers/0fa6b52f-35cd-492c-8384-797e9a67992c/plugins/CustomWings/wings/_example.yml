# This is a commented example config file for a wing.
# All wing configs that you want to use have to be in the 'wings' folder.
# The config's file name is the wing's ID. Used in the permission or the setwing command.
# You can recreate this file and the default wings by deleting the wings folder and reloading the plugin.

# When making changes in the main config or a wing config, you can use the customwings reload command.
# Addiontally you can use the ingame editor menu to change the settings.
# When deleting wings or change the config file names, you will have to restart your server.
